		<main id="mainEquipment">
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Left">1. A tank</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment1.svg" class="imgRight" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pLeft">The dimensions are up to you. I chose the small ones because I do not have much space in my bedroom, and also because of my budget. Also, I find small saltwater aquariums more charming, for some reason. But the smaller the tank is, the harder to maintain, because the problems spread quicker and in stronger concentration!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Right">2. A stand for your aquarium</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment2.svg" class="imgLeft" alt="stand illustration">
				<p class="pRight">It can be on a desk, if it is a very small one, but keep it mind the aquarium is going to be really heavy with all the water in it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Left">3. Lightning</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment3.svg" class="imgRight" alt="light illustration">
				<p class="pLeft">A mix of blue and white light is perfect for the coral to grow. I strongly recommend buying a good one, even if you have a tight budget.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Right">4. Protein skimmer and filtration system</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment4.svg" class="imgLeft" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pRight">The protein skimmer is important in a saltwater tank. It will deal with the dissolved organic compounds out of the aquarium. You can also take a biological filter to deal with these wastes, but I prefer having a good protein skimmer dealing with this and also have a filter that works for the 3 types of filtration (mechanical, biological and chemical).</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Left">5. Powerhead(s). </h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment5.svg" class="imgRight" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pLeft">This is the main equipment that will create current in your tank. The bigger the tank is, the more powerful they need to be. It is best to have the ones that make random movement, to simulate a real flow, but they cost more, and for what I have experienced I am doing just fine with my fixed powerheads.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Right">6. Liverock and sand</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment6.svg" class="imgLeft" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pRight">These are not only an aesthetic choice for your tank. It helps the fishes and other organisms to establish their territory, and to hide from time to time. But another big reason they are there is they act like a biological filter for the water. It also helps the nitrogen cycle to complete. The nitrogen cycle is something that you see in a new aquarium. It takes several weeks for it to be complete, and you should not put livestock before it is done, because the chemical in the water is unbalanced before that and it makes it dangerous for the creatures to live in it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Left">7. Heater</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment7.svg" class="imgRight" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pLeft">The water temperature should be around 84-88 ºF, and you will need a heater for it.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Right">8. Test kits, salt, and different products</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment8.svg" class="imgLeft" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pRight">You need to always take your parameters in your tank so you can react quickly if something starts to be wrong. There are a lot of  “test kits” on the market, which includes all the different products to make tests for your tank. If something goes wrong, you need to put the good product to put the parameters numbers back in place. Finally, you will obviously need salt to make salty water for your reef. The good ratio of salt per gallon is approximately 1.023. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="h2Left">9. Osmosis water</h2>
				<img src="../img/equipment9.svg" class="imgRight" alt="tank illustration">
				<p class="pLeft">Tap water contains undesirable stuff in it. You need Osmosis water to make sure the water is chemical free. You can find some in every specialized reef stores. </p>
