						<h3>Use different type of food for your fishes and others food eaters (like anemone and shrimps). </h3>
						<p>Varying food is important for a human, so is it for your little creatures.</p>

						<h3>Get a good “clean-up crew”</h3>
						<p>You need to have a good clean-up crew in your aquarium. Snails, starfish, sea urchin, hermit crabs and other detritivores will help removing the waste made by your fishes and pollution in general. It is also a nice way to add life in your aquarium. It does not count in the “ratio of fish per gallon of your aquarium” (see the ratio in Do not do list), so you can get quite a few without having problems.</p>

						<h3>If you only have 2 fishes and one of them die, remove the remaining fish from its habitat for about 2 hours before putting it back in with the new fish.</h3>
						<p>A fish alone, even if it is just one day, can become more aggressive towards intruders. Luckily, the brain of a fish is very small and it has very little memory power. If you remove the fish from its habitat, 2 hours later he will have forgotten everything and will not try to keep the territory for itself (it will try to blend in with the new fish, thinking he is invading his space, and the same feeling will be on the new fish, so both fishes will go well together).</p>

						<h3>Join FaceBook groups that are about Reefing.</h3>
						<p>There are plenty of groups waiting for you to join them so they can help you! You can go ask questions on these groups and people will gladly help you. There is even groups that specialize into trading corals, so once you are comfortable with the hobby, you can start looking at these groups and maybe do some trades.</p>

					<h2>Do not</h2>

						<h3>Don't start the hobby if you don't have the budget...</h3>
						<p>I started the hobby without really thinking how much it would cost me. At that time, I had no bills to pay, and decided to invest in a 10 gallons (it is a really small size of tank so cheaper but also harder to keep healthy). I had a budget of 1000$ (CAD), and I got everything for that amount. I did not pick the highest quality for every piece of equipment, but I took some pretty good ones for the price I paid. My only problem was my protein skimmer, and I decided after several months to take a better one. So I could say it is better if you put a little bit more money for better quality. This hobby is not cheap, and with cheap equipment you will get cheap result. Also, after my 1000$ was spent, I got a lot (I mean a LOT) of products to buy through the years to maintain the tank healthy. So it is not just a 1 payment and then you're good. Fishes die, coral die, you get pests, etc... it needs a serious budget just for maintenance. </p>

						<h3>DO NOT PUT SALT DIRECTLY IN THE AQUARIUM</h3>
						<p>I destroyed all my corals and my anemone within 10 seconds. They were alive, and then all dead. If the level of salt is lower than what it needs to be (approximatly1.023), do NOT put salt directly in the aquarium to equilibrate it. I lost all my corals and my rare anemone because of this mistake (almost 300$ of live stock). The salt concentration will be very unbalanced and some spots will have way too much salt. It will burn the coral or anemone alive and kill it instantly. Rip</p>

						<h3>Do not overload your aquarium</h3>
						<p>This is a controversial subject... How many fish per gallon can you put in your tank? The most popular answer would be to add 1 inch of fish per 5 gallons of water. I have 2 clown fishes in my 10 gallons. The local fish store’s guy told me I could add one more (but I think it is better to leave it at two, since they are about 1.2 inches each already).</p>

						<h3>Don't mix aggressive fishes with calm fishes.</h3>
						<p>Pretty easy tip, you just need to know (or ask) which fishes do not go well together. For example, the damsel family are more aggressive, and would try to kill a clown fish if they are in the same aquarium (especially if the aquarium is small). </p>
