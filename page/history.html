				<h2>Early 60's</h2>
				<p>First time we hear someone keeps reef livestock in an aquarium environment.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article2">
				<h2>Early 70's</h2>
				<p>The hobby starts in Europe, but it is not yet here in America.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article3">
				<h2>1978</h2>
				<p>the first magazine about the hobby in North America is published.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article4">
				<h2>Mid 80's</h2>
				<p>The hobby is well developed in Europe. Germany is a leader in term of technologies for reef aquariums, but these technologies and the knowledge does not make its way to North America yet.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article5">
				<h2>Late 80's</h2>
				<p>The hobby starts to be more developed. This period brings Protein Skimmer in North America, an important piece of equipment to keep the aquarium clean. The biggest problem at this time was the lighting.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article6">
				<h2>1989</h2>
				<p>In 1989, Alf Nilsen writes a series of texts for North America about reef keeping. His texts explain a lot of stuff; stuff that was totally unknown by the lobbyists, or stuff that confirms certain things people were already doing.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article7">
				<h2>1992</h2>
				<p>People want to ban the hobby, because the corals are taken from the ocean and die quickly in the aquariums. We also learn that we can “frag” corals, meaning we can split a big coral into smaller corals. A series of books also explain how to keep corals healthy.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article8">
				<h2>Mid 90's</h2>
				<p>People learn it is possible to have fishes in a reef tank. Before that, people were afraid that putting multiple fishes in the tank would make too much waste and poison the water, killing the corals.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article9">
				<h2>1996</h2>
				<p>Super Glue arrives. It makes the process of fragging corals way easier than the old technique (with rubber bands), and also better aesthetically.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article10">
				<h2>Also 1996</h2>
				<p>Blue light arrives. It helps for the coral to grow, but we also learns that we can feed the corals. This is a big revelation, because now we can get a small piece of coral and make it really big in not much time (with feeding and good lighting).</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article11">
				<h2>Early 2000's</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li id="firstLiHistory">Internet starts to be useful for hobbyists all around the world. There is not a lot of information although, but it is expanding fast.</li>

     					<li>There is a new type of tank in the hobby: the  nano tank. Instead of trying to get an aquarium as huge as possible, people ask themselves if they could have small tanks. But they see pretty quickly that the small tanks are harder to maintain healthy, because the parameters changes faster if there is a problem.</li>
     				</ul>
     			</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article12">
				<h2>2002</h2>
				<p>A company start aqua culturing in a big scale for corals in the US. This means they grow corals in farms instead of taking them from the reefs. Also, the European equipment arrives in North-America. </p>
			</article>


			<article id="article13">
				<h2>2003</h2>
				<p>Countries that has corals reefs like Indonesia start growing corals and export it in Europe and North-America. We know we can make a big colony of corals with just a small piece, so people are willing to pay for small fragment of coral. Internet also brings a way to buy corals online, so the companies can be anywhere in the world and sell their goods to Europe and North-America.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article14">
				<h2>2004</h2>
				<p>It was hard to keep corals alive since this period, because of the lack of equipment and knowledge. But now that we can maintain parameters right, the corals live longer, and it brings something new: pests. It is another challenge that will take several years before the main ones are documented with some solutions for the biggest problems.</p>
			</article>


			<article id="article15">
				<h2>2015</h2>
				<p>2015 is the year I joined the hobby. 2 years later, I had some problems with my tank, but it is still running and I do everything I can to make it a nice environment for my fishes, my shrimp, my snails, my starfishes and my sea urchin.</p>
